## About Me

An experienced statistician and programmer. I’m passionate about data and uncovering the stories behind the numbers. My main statistical tool is R but I also have experience with Python, SQL, C/C++, SAS, and Julia. 

When I’m not performing statistical analysis and modeling I’m an avid scuba diver, trail runner, and occasional improviser.
