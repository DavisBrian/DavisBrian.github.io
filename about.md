An experienced statistician and programmer with a particular talent for automating repeated analyses and code optimization.  I’m passionate about data and uncovering the stories behind the numbers. I am a skilled programmer, in particular with R, which is my main statistical tool. I also have experience with Python, SQL, C/C++, SAS, and Julia.  I'm willing to learn any tool that helps get the job done. 

When I’m not performing statistical analysis and modeling I’m an avid scuba diver and trail runner.
