This is an introductory post testing that I have everything setup correctly and a sensible workflow.

## Veiw of this blog

I want to be able to write about the statistics and R related things that come up in the course of my work.  Mainly this blog will serve as an aid to my coworkers.  I typically have to make documents that are shorter than a formal white paper, but need to be more extensive than an email or a conversation.  Hopefully, this will bridge that gap.

## Quick Demo

Trying to insert a basic table and plot

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

See if I can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
